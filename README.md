Week 03 Assignment (secondstring.py):
There are many methods for reversing strings in Python. The quickest, and probably the easiest one is through slicing.
Slicing method is explained in W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_howto_reverse_string.asp
Other methods, such as loop, join() and reversed(), or reversed list can be found in JournalDev: 
https://www.journaldev.com/23647/python-reverse-string
To reverse by using the slicing method, we use the following argument/syntax:
inputString = "Some text"
outputString = inputString[::-n], where [(first index):(last index):(step)]
